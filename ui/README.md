# Data Scraper UI

This directory contains the Streamlit UI for the Data Scraper project.

## Running the UI

From the project root directory:

```bash
cd ui
streamlit run app.py
```

The app should open automatically in your default web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Modifying the UI

The UI integrates with your existing Data Scraper modules. If you make changes to those modules,
the UI will automatically use the updated functionality.

To add new features to the UI, edit the `app.py` file and add new tabs or components as needed.
